# student-academic-performance-prediction
A machine learning project that predicts students’ final academic scores using linear regression and real-time user input.
📌 Project Overview
Problem Type: Regression
Model Used: Linear Regression
Dataset: Student Academic Performance Dataset
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
The model is trained on historical student data and allows real-time prediction using user input from the terminal.

🚀 Features
Data cleaning & preprocessing
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²
Interactive user input
Predicts final score instantly

📊 Model Performance
MAE  : ~2.36
RMSE : ~2.93
R²   : ~86%

🔮 Future Improvements
